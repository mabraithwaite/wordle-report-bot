# Wordle Report Bot

A basic cloud application that receives texts from Twilio, stores scores sent in the format Wordle gives by default, and allows you to tally the results for display. Created because the group I do Wordle with every day would tally the scores manually each week and this is just more automatic. Requires creating your own Twilio and AWS accounts obviously. 

## Get Started
1. It's best if you have an understanding of AWS CDK, but at the very least you need to configure your device with your AWS credentials. You can follow the AWS CDK prerequisites guide here https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_prerequisites

1. When your credentials are configured, install the projects dependencies with:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
    then run:
    ```
    npm run cdk -- deploy --all
    ```
    This will deploy the wordle bot stack to your aws account. **Copy the two REST API endpoints generated by this command:**
    ```
    main endpoint: https://GUUID.execute-api.REGION.amazonaws.com/prod/twilio
    failure endpoint: https://GUUID.execute-api.REGION.amazonaws.com/prod/failure
    ```
    ***IMPORTANT:*** This deployment can incur expenses to your AWS account along with any usage of the resources this stack creates.

    ***IMPORTANT:*** This stack creates public API endpoints that can be called by anyone, be wary of this.

1. Go to your Twilio account and create a messaging service. Add the two endpoint urls generated by the previous command as the endpoints called by [Twilio's webhooks](https://www.twilio.com/docs/messaging/guides/webhook-request).

Now you're ready to go! Send a text to the number associated with your Twilio messaging service, and may the best Wordler win!
