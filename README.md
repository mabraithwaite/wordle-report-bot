# Wordle Report Bot

A basic cloud application that receives texts from Twilio, stores scores sent in the format Wordle gives by default, and allows you to tally the results for display. Created because the group I do Wordle with every day would tally the scores manually each week and this is just more automatic. Requires creating your own Twilio and AWS accounts obviously. Twilio message service should point to the api endpoint generated by this cdk app:

```
main endpoint: https://GUUID.execute-api.REGION.amazonaws.com/prod/twilio
failure endpoint: https://GUUID.execute-api.REGION.amazonaws.com/prod/failure
```

## Useful commands

* `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
* `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
* `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
* `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
